This subproject focuses on the democratic effects of the increasingly fluid allocation of competences across multiple layers of government. The sub-project first produces a much-needed categorization of the formal institutional frameworks of subnational administrations in European countries. There is enormous variety in the institutional structures of subnational administrations in European countries, and also within countries institutions of subnational units can be very dissimilar. A categorization of these institutional architectures is indispensable to study the interaction (or discrepancy) between formal and informal politics in subnational units. 

To analyze the democratic consequences of multi-level governance, the sub-project subsequently examines interactions between various administrative layers in the four selected countries. Building on my extensive interviewing experience, I will conduct expert interviews with politicians involved in these interactions. These interviews are complemented by a content analysis of documents and reports produced during meetings between politicians representing various administrations. 

Decentralization has been accompanied by increasing intermunicipal cooperation and the creation of new governance networks. Examining the nature and outcomes of their interactions provides crucial insights into the representativeness and responsiveness of these governance networks. The interviews and content analysis will generate vital insights into the democratic effects of multi-level governance from the perspective of politicians. To examine how these dynamics are experienced by citizens, the results of the interviews and content analysis are contrasted with the outcomes of the opinion survey conducted by subproject 2.
